# aapi_lab: Control-M Automation API lab

Some files to demo a number of use cases for initial understanding of Control-M Automation API (AAPI)
- UC1: transform a job with Deploy Descriptors without SiteStandards (Site Standard set to None which is an empty Site Standard)
- UC2: migrating a job from one environment to another with Deploy Descriptors enforcing Site Standards.
- UC3: Show the use of the deploy service with XML format (for jobtypes like MF that are not supported by AAPI as of this writing)
- UC4: Demo a python program that reads a folder and prints it
